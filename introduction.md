### What is database ?
> It is a collection of Data(or information) stored in a format that can easily be accessed.

### What is DBMS ?
> Any Database Management System isn't the actual database.But in order to create/manage the database we need a software application that is DBMS.

### Advantages of DBMS :-
- Makes it  easy to handle large amount of data.
- Import/exports of data
- Security
- Backup

- SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases(RDBMS)whereas NoSQL databases are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database.

- SQl Databases are table based databases ,whereas  NoSQL are document based,key-value pairs,graph databases.

- SQL databases are vertically scalable whereas noSQL databases are horizontally scalable.

- SQL :- Oracle,Postgres,MS-SQL etc.
 NoSQL :- MongoDB,Redis,Cassandra etc.
### What is RDBMS ?
-   RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System. RDBMS is the basis for SQL, and for all modern database systems like MS SQL Server, IBM DB2, Oracle, MySQL, and Microsoft Access.

-   A Relational database management system (RDBMS) is a database management system (DBMS) that is based on the relational model as introduced by E. F. Codd.
-   e.g :- MySQL ,SQLite , Postgres SQL ,Oracle etc.


####    A Relational DataBase Management System (RDBMS) is a software that :−

-   Enables you to implement a database with tables, columns and indexes.

-   Guarantees the Referential Integrity between rows of various tables.

-   Updates the indexes automatically.

-   Interprets an SQL query and combines information from various tables.
### What is a Database in MySQL?
-   A database is a separate application that stores a collection of data. Each database has one or more distinct APIs for creating, accessing, managing, searching and replicating the data it holds.

-   Nowadays, we use relational database management systems (RDBMS) to store and manage the huge volume of data. This is called relational database because all the data is stored into different tables and relations are established using primary keys or other keys known as Foreign Keys.

### MySQL VS SQL 
- While SQL is a language used for operating different relational databases, MySQL boasts of being the first open-source relational database in the early 90s. SQL is a query language, whereas MySQL is a relational database that uses SQL to query a database.

-   You can use SQL to access, update, and manipulate the data stored in a database. However, MySQL is a database that stores the existing data in a database in an organized manner. 
SQL is used for writing queries for databases, MySQL facilitates data storing, modifying, and management in a tabular format. 

### Terminologies related to the database

-   Database − A database is a collection of tables, with related data.

-   Table − A table is a matrix with data. A table in a database looks like a simple spreadsheet.

-   Column − One column (data element) contains data of one and the same kind, for example the column postcode.

-   Row − A row (= tuple, entry or record) is a group of related data, for example the data of one subscription.

-   Redundancy − Storing data twice, redundantly to make the system faster.

-  Primary Key − A primary key is unique. A key value can not occur twice in one table. With a key, you can only find one row.

-   Foreign Key − A foreign key is the linking pin between two tables.

-   Compound Key − A compound key (composite key) is a key that consists of multiple columns, because one column is not sufficiently unique.

-   Index − An index in a database resembles an index at the back of a book.

-   Referential Integrity − Referential Integrity makes sure that a foreign key value always points to an existing row.

### MySQL Database
  MySQL is a fast, easy-to-use RDBMS being used for many small and big businesses. MySQL is developed, marketed and supported by MySQL AB, which is a Swedish company. MySQL is becoming so popular because of many good reasons :-

-   MySQL is released under an open-source license. So you have nothing to pay to use it.

-   MySQL is a very powerful program in its own right. It handles a large subset of the functionality of the most expensive and powerful database packages.

-   MySQL uses a standard form of the well-known SQL data language.

-   MySQL works on many operating systems and with many languages including PHP, PERL, C, C++, JAVA, etc.

-   MySQL works very quickly and works well even with large data sets.

-   MySQL is very friendly to PHP, the most appreciated language for web development.

-   MySQL supports large databases, up to 50 million rows or more in a table. The default file size limit for a table is 4GB, but you can increase this (if your operating system can handle it) to a theoretical limit of 8 million terabytes (TB).

-   MySQL is customizable. The open-source GPL license allows programmers to modify the MySQL software to fit their own specific environments.


### What is NULL value ?
NULL means the value is unknown ,it is not Zero.

### Foreign Key
